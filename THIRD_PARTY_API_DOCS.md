# Third-Party API Integration Documentation

## Overview

The Third-Party API feature analyzes your PRD (Product Requirements Document) and automatically identifies **generic categories** of external APIs that your project will need (e.g., Payment Processing, Maps, Authentication). The user can then choose which specific third-party provider to use for each category. This helps teams understand what types of third-party integrations are required before development begins.

## Endpoint

### GET `/api/get_thirdparty`

Retrieves a list of third-party APIs required for the project based on PRD analysis.

**Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (automatically sent by frontend)

**Query Parameters:**
- `user_id` (optional): The ID of the user
- `project_id` (optional): The ID of the project

**Response Structure:**

```json
{
  "apis": [
    {
      "name": "Payment Processing",
      "category": "payment|maps|oauth|email|sms|cloud|database|storage|messaging",
      "description": "Brief description of what this API category does",
      "purpose": "Why this API category is needed for the project",
      "features": [
        "Feature 1",
        "Feature 2",
        "Feature 3"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 7,
    "categories": ["payment", "maps", "oauth", "sms", "email", "storage", "messaging"]
  },
  "analyzed_at": "2025-10-08T12:00:00",
  "prd_version": "1.0.0"
}
```

**Note:** The response returns **generic API categories**, not specific providers. For example, it returns "Payment Processing" instead of "Stripe" or "PayPal". This allows users to choose their preferred provider for each category.

**Empty Response** (when no third-party APIs are needed):
```json
{}
```

## Frontend Implementation

The `ThirdPartyAPI.jsx` component automatically:

1. **Fetches data on load** - Retrieves third-party API requirements when the page loads
2. **Displays different states:**
   - **Loading state** - Shows a spinner while analyzing the PRD
   - **Empty state** - Shows "No Third-Party APIs Needed" when the response is empty
   - **Success state** - Displays API cards with detailed information
   - **Error state** - Shows error message with retry option

3. **Features visual API cards** with:
   - Category-specific icons (payment, maps, OAuth, etc.)
   - API category name
   - Description
   - "Why It's Needed" section explaining the purpose
   - List of key features

## API Categories & Icons

The component automatically assigns icons based on API category:

- **Payment** (üí≥) - Payment processing services
- **Maps** (üó∫Ô∏è) - Location and mapping services
- **OAuth** (üîê) - Authentication and authorization
- **Authentication** (üîë) - Auth services
- **Cloud** (‚òÅÔ∏è) - Cloud platforms
- **Database** (üóÑÔ∏è) - Database services
- **Email** (üìß) - Email delivery services
- **Messaging** (üí¨) - Push notifications and messaging
- **SMS** (üì±) - SMS services
- **Storage** (üíæ) - Cloud storage services
- **Default** (üîå) - Generic APIs

## Mock Data

The mock backend (`mock_backend.py`) provides sample data with generic API categories:

1. **Payment Processing** - Credit card processing, subscriptions, refunds
2. **Maps & Location Services** - Geocoding, place search, route planning
3. **Authentication & Authorization** - Social login, SSO, MFA
4. **SMS & Messaging** - SMS delivery, phone verification
5. **Email Services** - Transactional and marketing emails
6. **Cloud Storage** - Object storage for files and media
7. **Push Notifications** - Mobile and web push notifications

To simulate "no third-party APIs needed", uncomment line 691 in `mock_backend.py`:
```python
return {}
```

## Usage Flow

1. User uploads a PRD through the PRD page
2. Backend analyzes the PRD to identify required third-party API **categories** (not specific providers)
3. User navigates to "3rd Party API" page
4. Page automatically fetches and displays the identified API categories
5. User reviews what types of integrations are needed (Payment, Maps, Auth, etc.)
6. User can then choose which specific provider to use for each category (e.g., Stripe vs PayPal for payments)

## Design Philosophy

The system intentionally shows **generic API categories** rather than specific providers because:
- Different projects may prefer different providers based on cost, features, or existing relationships
- Avoids vendor lock-in
- Gives flexibility to the development team
- Focuses on "what" is needed rather than "which provider" to use

## Testing

1. Start the mock backend:
   ```bash
   python mock_backend.py
   ```

2. Navigate to the Third-Party API page in the application

3. The page will display the mock third-party API categories

4. Test the empty state by uncommenting line 690 in `mock_backend.py` to return `{}`

## Future Enhancements

- AI-powered PRD analysis to automatically detect API category requirements
- Provider comparison and recommendations for each category
- Integration cost estimates per provider
- API configuration templates
- Direct API key management
- Integration code snippets for popular providers
- Provider selection workflow
